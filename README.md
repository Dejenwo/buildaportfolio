##**Syllabus**
**Lesson 1 - From Design to Code**
Diligently employ a code/test/refine strategy as you precisely and deliberately translate initial design documents into static web
pages. You'll also investigate the Document Object Model (DOM) and its implications for web development.

**Lesson 2 - Your Own Framework**
Take pride in creating and personalising your own multi-platform, responsive CSS framework for publishing your professional portfolio projects to the web.

**Lesson 3 - Learning and Using Bootstrap**
Strategically investigate an existing professional CSS framework as you use it to build a website using responsive design principles while maintaining code readability.
